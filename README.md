Random Password Generator w/ Prompts

## Project Description

This is a 'random password generator' that accepts input via prompts. The user can select between 8 and 128 characters, and whether or not they'd like their password to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters and/or numbers. Upon button click, the prompts cycle to collect the user input, then eventually result in a secure password, which is displayed in the designated html textarea.

The entirety of the password is generated with one *large* if, else if, else, if... function. Comments in the JS explain the process in greater detail.

## Project Criteria

When button is clicked, a series of prompts are presented ✔

When prompted, the user is able to select the criteria desired to build a secure password ✔

When prompted for the length, the user can choose at least 8 characters, but no more than 128 characters ✔

When asked for character types, lowerscase, uppercase, numeric and special characters are options ✔

When the user selects a character type to include in their password generation, it is valdiated ✔

At least one character type is required ✔

The password generated matches the selected criteria and is displayed ✔

## Design Notes

I've seen other password generators that use much simpler *methods* to both place character data in arrays and also refer to those arrays when generating the password. However, this is built with what I felt I could actually explain to someone else!
